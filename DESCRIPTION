Description: Estimate sample size based on precision rather than
    power. 'precisely' is a study planning tool to calculate sample size
    based on precision. Power calculations are focused
    on whether or not an estimate will be statistically significant;
    calculations of precision are based on the same principles as power
    calculation but turn the focus to the width of the confidence
    interval. 'precisely' is based on the work of Rothman and Greenland 
    (2018) <doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000876>.
